# Cat-Dog-Classification-using-CNN
This project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model** that classifies images of cats and dogs.   It is built in **Python** using **TensorFlow/Keras** and demonstrates image preprocessing, CNN training, and evaluation with accuracy/loss plots and a confusion matrix.
